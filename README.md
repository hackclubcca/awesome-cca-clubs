# Note:

Understandably, there are a lot of CS clubs, and I encourage you to give all of them a try at some point - don't stick to one club in hopes that it'll get more interesting though - only participate in those clubs that you truly feel passionate about. Clubs such as those listed below should not be a way for you to add a point on a resume/college app, but rather an early gateway to the world of CS here at CCA.
